1. Project Preparation
Deadline Awareness:
Presentations: Dec 4th & 9th, 2024
Report Submission: Dec 13th, 2024
Dataset Familiarity:
Heart Disease Dataset

2. Research Question and Hypothesis
Choose Research Hypothesis:
…
Identify Relevant Variables:
Potential variables: 
Formulate Statistical Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis:
Alternative Hypothesis:

3. Data Preprocessing and Exploration
Initial Steps:
Load the dataset into Python using pandas.
Handle missing values and preprocess categorical data.
Descriptive Statistics:
Number of observations and variables.
Frequency distribution of demographic variables (gender, age groups, habits?).
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Visualization:
anything

4. Data Analysis
Graphical Analysis:
Create visualizations.
Statistical Model:
Choose a model based on the hypothesis:
Logistic Regression (if predicting binary heart disease outcome).
Linear Regression (if exploring continuous relationships).
Run the model using statsmodels or sklearn.
Model Interpretation:
Analyze coefficients, p-values, and goodness-of-fit metrics.
Explain whether the results support the hypothesis.

5. GitHub Configuration Management
Create GitHub Repository:
Set up a repository and follow good practices for version control.
Documentation:
Include a README with project overview and instructions for running the analysis.
Add comments in the Python scripts for clarity.
Version Control:
Use branches for testing major features.
Merge and track progress with meaningful commit messages.
